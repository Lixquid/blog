**Javascript**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, the
trigger is not part of the standard library, and you have to load a 50kg addon
to add it. When you attempt to fire the gun, you find the library has been
removed.

**Python**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately you're
used to a slightly different gun with the same name and end up ejecting the
magazine. This is considered "pythonic".

**C**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you
accidentally put one too many bullets in the magazine, so the whole universe
stops.

**C++**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you use a
deprecated bullet and the gun explodes. You decide to just use Boost's pre-shot
foot instead.

**SQL**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you forgot
to specify your foot in the `WHERE` clause, so you end up shooting your foot,
the ground, and everything else in the Universe.

**PowerShell**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately,
workflows do not support feet, and you end up silently shooting nothing.

**sh, ksh, etc.**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately,
you forgot to quote "your foot", and you end up shooting yourself, then
complaining you can't find your feet.

```
$ ls
you.head you.body you_left.foot you_right.foot
$ rm * .foot
rm: cannot remove '.foot': No such file or directory
$ ls
$
```

**CSS**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, the ".foot"
selector matches a lot of elements, and you end up shooting most things on the
page. You also miss your own foot, because its margins move it from where its
supposed to be.

**Go**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, the shoot
method doesn't explicitly accept your type of gun. When you attempt to use the
right gun, it fails, and you have no idea why because you didn't explicitly ask
it.

**Rust**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you're not
allowed to fire the bullet because the magazine still has borrower access.

**PHP**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you can't
remember if it's called `shootgun`, `shoot_gun`, or `shoot2gun`. When you give
up and throw the gun at your foot, it
[screams at you in Hebrew](http://www.phpsadness.com/sad/1).

**Java**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you loaded
2 guns, but no bullets.

**XML**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you can't
actually shoot anything, only describe the gun in very vivid detail.

**JSON**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you can't
actually shoot anything, only describe the gun in very vivid detail, until you
try to comment on the situation and die.

**Git**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, someone else
somewhere in the universe shot their foot before you pull the trigger, and your
shooting fails. You fix the issue by throwing away your gun and getting their
gun instead.

**Selenium**: You attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Unfortunately, you
attempt to chamber a round, aim at your foot, pull the trigger, and wince in
pain before the magazine is in the gun.
