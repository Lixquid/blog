Welcome back to the Small Shelf Games series; a series of posts about games that
can be played with generic game components that are small, easy to store, and
don't need you to break the bank to play.

Today, we're looking at No Mercy, also known as Hit!; a delightfully simple
push-your-luck card game with only a couple of rules, but with all the
electrifying tension of a full blackjack table of people egging you on to just
keep drawing one more card.

## No Mercy

- _Players_: 2-5
	- _Recommended_: 4
- _Complexity_: Low
- _Type_: Push Your Luck
- _Required_:
	- Three identical decks of 52 Standard Playing Cards.

## Game Setup

1. Take 11 Ace, Two, Three, Four, and Five cards from each deck and put them
   into a separate pile. The pile should have 55 cards so far.
2. Take 7 Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten cards from each deck and put them
   into the pile. The pile should now have 90 cards.
3. Discard the remaining cards from the decks.

This central pile of 90 cards is now the deck for the game. Suits don't matter,
only the rank of the cards.

## Round Setup

1. Shuffle the deck, and put it in the center of the table. This is the Draw
   Pile.
2. Decide which player will go first.

> **Tip**: Not sure who should go first? Try the player with the largest hat!

## Gameplay

Each player acts in turn until the round ends. On each player's turn:

1. Collect all the face-up cards in your tableau (the area in front of you) and
   put them face-down into your Loot Pile. (For your first turn, you won't have
   any face-up cards.)
2. Decide whether to *Draw* or *Stop*.
	- If you *Draw*, turn the top card over, and place it face-up in your
	  tableau. Check the [Draw](#section-draw) section below. You can *Draw* as
	  many times as you like, until you either decide to *Stop* or you *Bust*.
	- If you *Stop*, your turn ends; it's now the next player's turn.

<h3 id="section-draw">Draw</h3>

So, you've just revealed a card from the Draw Pile; first or tenth, what
happens next is the same:

- If the card matches a card already in your tableau, you've *Bust*; put all
  the cards in your tableau into the Discard Pile. Those cards are out of the
  game, and your turn is over.
	- **Important**: This only applies if you have *three or more* cards in
	  your tableau when you draw a matching card. If you have two or fewer
	  cards, you can add it to your tableau, and choose to *Draw* or *Stop*
	  as normal.
- If the card doesn't match any cards in your tableau, add it to a new column
  in your tableau.
- *Optionally*, you can choose to take any face-up cards that match the rank of
  the card you just drew from all other players' tableaus and add them to your
  own tableau.
- You can now choose to *Draw* or *Stop* again, as above.

### Tableau Layout

When placing cards in your tableau, you should arrange them in columns, with
duplicate ranks you've stolen from other players kept in the same column.
Slightly offset each card in the column so that everyone can see how many cards
are in each column.

This is to ensure that everyone can easily see the contents of everyone else's
tableaus when considering whether to steal cards or push their luck.

## Ending the Round

The instant the last card is drawn from the Draw Pile, the round ends. If the
last card drawn causes a *Bust*, the player who drew it loses their current
tableau as normal, otherwise everyone collects their tableau cards into their
Loot Piles.

Everyone now adds up the values of the cards in their Loot Piles; the player
with the highest total wins the round.

And that's it! You can play for one round, track round wins, play to a set
target score over multiple rounds, or whatever you like. The tension of
having to keep your tableau out for anyone to steal from, and seeing everyone
else with juicy cards you could steal, makes for a great game with only a few
simple rules.

## Glossary

- **Draw Pile**: The face-down pile of cards in the center of the table where
  cards are drawn into the *Tableau* from. Once this is empty, the round ends.
- **Tableau**: The area where face-up cards that a player collects by *Stopping*
  are placed. Cards can be *stolen* from the Tableau by other players when they
  draw a card of the same rank. When it's your turn, all the cards in your
  Tableau are placed face-down in your *Loot Pile*.
- **Loot Pile**: The face-down pile of cards each player has in front of them.
  Cards in the Loot Pile count as your score at the end of the round, and
  cannot be stolen from.
- **Draw**: The action of turning over the top card of the *Draw Pile* and
  placing it in your *Tableau*. If the card matches a card already in your
  Tableau, you *Bust*.
- **Bust**: Revealing a card of a rank that's already in your *Tableau* when
  you *Draw*. You lose all the cards in your Tableau to the *Discard Pile*,
  and your turn ends.
- **Discard Pile**: The face-down pile of cards from players' *Tableaus* that
  have been *Busted*. Cards in the Discard Pile are out of the game, and don't
  count towards anyone's score.
