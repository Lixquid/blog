The NATO phonetic alphabet is a standardized set of words used to represent letters in the English alphabet. If you've ever stumbled over spelling something out loud over the phone or in a noisy environment, this alphabet can help clarify communication.

|             |              |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| **A**lfa    | **N**ovember |
| **B**ravo   | **O**scar    |
| **C**harlie | **P**apa     |
| **D**elta   | **Q**uebec   |
| **E**cho    | **R**omeo    |
| **F**oxtrot | **S**ierra   |
| **G**olf    | **T**ango    |
| **H**otel   | **U**niform  |
| **I**ndia   | **V**ictor   |
| **J**uliett | **W**hiskey  |
| **K**ilo    | **X**-ray    |
| **L**ima    | **Y**ankee   |
| **M**ike    | **Z**ulu     |
| ---         | ---          |
| Zee-ro      | Fife         |
| Wun         | Six          |
| Too         | Seven        |
| Tree        | Ait          |
| Fow-er      | Nin-er       |

> **Note**: The numbers are also pronounced in a specific way (and with additions such as the "er" in "Nin-er") to avoid confusion with important words or similar-sounding numbers. For example, "Fife" is used instead of "Five" to avoid confusion with "Fire".
