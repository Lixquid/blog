This is for anyone that uses files on a computer, which is probably most people
reading this.

Imagine this overwhelmingly likely scenario; you have a file that you're about
to make a new version of. Maybe it's a document, maybe it's a folder. So you
make a copy of it, name it `file_old`, and move ahead with `file`. Time passes,
`file` maybe gets moved, has a few more versions, a few more `_old` progeny.

Eventually, it's time to clean up. You go through your files, and you find
roughly eleven thousand files with `_old` in the name. Thanks to endless
shuffling, you can't rely on the timestamp to tell you which is the most recent,
and you can't just delete them all because you might need one of them. Oh no.

Here's the simple solution I use; when you make a new `_old`, add the date on
the end in `YYYYMMDD` format. So, if it was currently the 10th of December 2023,
you'd have `file_old_20231210`. Now, when you're cleaning up, you immediately
know which are newer than others. Stepping through the files in date order will
show you which versions were incremental, and which were major changes!
