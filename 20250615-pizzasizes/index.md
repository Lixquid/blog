The area of a circle is π×r², where r is the radius of the circle.

Which is great for school, but not so much when you're working out pizza sizes.
It's counterintuitive, but you really get so much more pizza with a larger
diameter.

So, here's a table.

| Diameter | Area   | Increase from previous |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| 4        | 12.57  |                        |
| 5        | 19.63  | +7.07                  |
| 6        | 28.27  | +8.64                  |
| 7        | 38.48  | +10.21                 |
| 8        | 50.27  | +11.78                 |
| 9        | 63.62  | +13.35                 |
| 10       | 78.54  | +14.92                 |
| 11       | 95.03  | +16.49                 |
| 12       | 113.10 | +18.06                 |
| 13       | 132.73 | +19.63                 |
| 14       | 153.94 | +21.21                 |
| 15       | 176.71 | +22.78                 |
| 16       | 201.06 | +24.35                 |
| 17       | 226.98 | +25.92                 |
| 18       | 254.47 | +27.49                 |

...and so on.
