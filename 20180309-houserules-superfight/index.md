[Superfight](https://www.superfightlive.com/) is a party card game which
involves being dealt a random superhero and then arguing a lot. This makes it
excellent to play with new people and/or while drunk.

The base ruleset kind of suffers from not being flexible enough to bad
situations, so we created these house rules to try and help people out.

## Cards ##

- **White Cards** are *Character Cards*. They can be your hero, or a sidekick
  for your hero.
- **Black Cards** are *Modifier Cards*. They change something about a
  *Character Card*; either giving them a weapon, adding new abilities, or
  changing their body / behaviour.

> **Note**: **Red Cards** are NSFW cards, and are actually either a *Black* or
> *White* card, depending on the colour of the back.

## Rounds ##

1. At the start of each round, each player draws 3 *Black Cards*, and 3
   *White Cards*.
2. Individually, each player combines one *White Card* and one *Black Card* to
   create the most entertaining / deadly superhero they can, and put the cards
   face down in front of them.

    1. Optionally, if your hand is complete garbage, you can instead choose to
       discard your entire hard to draw a random *White Card* and random
       *Black Card*. This is creating *Rando* the Superhero.

3. After all heroes are created, each player starting from the "dealer's" left
   and continuing clock-wise reveals the hero they have created.
4. Starting from the "dealer's" left, each player then chooses to:

    1. Put a *Black Card* from their hand onto any superhero, their own or an
       opponents. This can be used to buff / debuff any hero!

        > **Example**: Opponent is King Kong? Make him 6 inches tall!

    2. Or, draw a random *Black Card* from the pile and play it only on your
       own Superhero. If you're playing with *Rando*, this is the only thing
       you can do!

5. After everyone has buffed / debuffer one hero, the fight begins! Everyone
   attempts to explain why their superhero would beat / outlast / enslave all
   the others.
6. Once a victor has been decided / a draw is determined / everyone gets bored
   explaining the science behind Micheal Jackson's Lightning Breath Attack,
   everyone's hands and heroes are discarded, and a new round commences.

## Edge Cases ##

1. When two cards contradict each other, whichever was added last takes effect.
2. When cumulative cards are played, it's in sequential order. This can vastly
   change how your hero works!

    > **Example**:
    > 1. `Genghis Khan` + `In a Helicopter` + `100 of them` = 100 helicopters,
    >    each piloted by Genghis Khan.
    > 1. `Genghis Khan` + `100 of them` + `In a Helicopter` = 1 helicopter, with
    >    100 Genghis Khans stuffed inside of it!

3. It's not about winning, it's about explaining why a goldfish with a death
   ray would beat Lord Voldemort if he was on bath salts.
