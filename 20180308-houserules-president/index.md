Another card game popular among my friends, although less so than Prediction
Whist. This relies more on luck, but because it's far more flexible to the
number of players you can add more decks and have far more people playing.

## Requirements ##

- A standard 52 playing card deck
- One Joker

## Glossary ##

- **President**: The player currently in first place.
- **Shithead**: The player currently in last place.
- **Vice** (Vice President / Vice Shithead): The player in second / second last
  place, respectively.
    > **Note**: With 3 players or less, there are no *Vice*s.

## Card Strength ##

Cards have a unique order:

1. The Joker is the strongest card
2. Next is `2`s
3. Next is Aces
4. Next is Kings, and so on and so forth, down to `3`s

## Before the Round ##

- Deal the entire deck to all players present.
- If this is the first Round of the game, skip this section and go straight to
  *During the Round*.
- The President and the Shithead swap 2 cards. This is done by placing the
  two cards you want to give face down in front of you, and then swapping when
  both players have placed cards. This is to prevent whatever the opposite
  person is giving influencing what you give.
    - The Shithead must give their 2 empirically best cards.
    - The President can give whatever 2 cards they want.
- If the game has a Vice President and Vice Shithead, they repeat the steps as
  above, but instead only surrender 1 card to each other.

## During the Round ##

- The President starts play. If this is the first round and there is no
  President, the person to the Dealer's left starts play.
- The person starting play can either play a single card, a pair / triple /
  quad of cards of the same value.
- The next person clockwise must then play the same number of cards, but of a
  higher value than played.
    > **Example**: If Player A plays a Pair of `6`s, Player B must play a Pair,
    > and it must be a Pair of `7`s or higher.
- If the person cannot play, they can instead *Pass*.
- If every player *Passes* except the one who last played, the current stack
  is burned and the player who last played can now start play as above.
- The order that people get rid of all of their cards determines their rank:
    - The First player is the President
    - The Second player is the Vice President
    - The Second to Last player is the Vice Shithead
    - The Last player is the Shithead

## The Joker ##

The Joker is a special card. It has multiple special properties:

- If played as a single card, it will beat a `2`.
- It can be used as a "wildcard" in a group, assuming the value of anything
  else in that group.
    > **Example**: A King and a Joker is the same value as a pair of Kings.
- If it is used as any part of a player's final play (if they go out
  immediately after playing it), that player *instantly* becomes the Shithead.

## Variations ##

- Fall from Grace
    - The player who was the President last round must go out first in the
      next round, or they will instantly become the Shithead.
- Revolution
    - If at any point a quad is played (using a Joker or not), the ranks of all
      of the cards (except the Joker) are reversed. `3` becomes the most
      powerful non-Joker card, and `2` becomes the weakest.

## Automatic Shithead Rankings ##

Multiple circumstances can cause players to become the Shithead. Player rank is
determined as (Higher means higher rank):

- Order players go out
- Fall from Grace
- Playing the Joker as the last play

> **Example**:
> 1. Player A went out first, but used a Joker on the last hand
> 2. Player B went out second, but was the President and has fell from grace
> 3. Player C went out last
>
> Rankings:
> 1. Player C is the President (despite going out last)
> 2. Player B
> 3. Player A is the Shithead (despite going out first)
