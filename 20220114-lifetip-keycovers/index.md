Welcome to the first in a series of posts around "Life Tips"; small little nuggets of (maybe) useful wisdom that I wish I'd known.

First up is a very mundane affair; keys! Not cryptography keys, real world keys with little metal teeth. Depending on how many places you need to get into, you may find yourself with quite a lot of keys on your keychain. This is a problem if they look quite similar.

A solution I've used is getting a pack of Key Covers; brightly coloured circles of plastic that just slip over the head of the key, and make it easy to tell at a glance which key is what.

They've got a few advantages over other solutions;

- Stickers need a solid surface to adhere to, and typically rub off from metal
  quite easily.
- Permanent marker usually only comes in a few colours, and also permanently
  marks the key in question.
- Key tags (little plastic containers with a card you can write on) can be
  bulky if you have enough keys that need an organization system in the first
  place, and can get smudged if wet.
